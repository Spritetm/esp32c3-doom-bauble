 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Here is a core component: drawing the floors and ceilings,
 *       while maintaining a per column clipping list only.
 *      Moreover, the sky areas have to be determined.
 *
 * MAXVISPLANES is no longer a limit on the number of visplanes,
 * but a limit on the number of hash slots; larger numbers mean
 * better performance usually but after a point they are wasted,
 * and memory and time overheads creep in.
 *
 * For more information on visplanes, see:
 *
 * http://classicgaming.com/doom/editing/
